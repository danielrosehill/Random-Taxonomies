# Taxonomy Collections

Taxonomies are super useful in organising data and storing information.

I created this repository to store taxonomies that I generate for various purposes (lately, the purpose is often creating organisational structures for organising custom GPTs and GPT outputs).

## How The Taxonomies Are Generated

My useful workflow is something like:

- Ask AI to come up with a taxonomy (`Please provide an alphabetical list of 30 categories that should encompass the majority of GPT generations`)
- Refine the prompt or edit the output until I'm happy with the list
- Export to CSV
- Use in something like Airtable, NocoDB or ... any other random purposes.

## File Format

Unless otherwise intended or due to human error, the taxonomies will be shared as comma separated value (CSV) files - AKA "flat" data which is versatile, lightweight, and ideal for easily importing long list of taxonomies into database systems.

## Scope

Because there are gazillions of places on the internet to get incredibly common taxonomies like a list of countries (or currencies' two letter ISO identifiers) I'll generally try to avoid creating redundant data by publishing them here. 

My objective here is to create some nicely curated taxonomies that have had a little bit of human thought put into them. 

As with everything in the world of organising information, the choice of values for a given topic reflects some degree of subjective judgment. So tinker with the lists as you see fit or to better serve the needs of your project/use-case.
